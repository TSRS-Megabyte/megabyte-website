If you're looking to apply your knowledge of tech and programming to gain awards and recognition, the best way to do so is through competitive events.

Aside from participating competitions through school, there are also a number of events organised every year by large organisations. These are typically extremely competitive, but carry significant prizes and prestige. They're also a great opportunity for you to learn through working on a real project, and to connect with teammates from all over the world!

## Hackathons and programming events

### MIT Solv[ED] Youth Innovation Challenge

**Typical timeframe**: January-February

**Eligibility**: 13 to 24-year-old individuals or teams

Organised by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, this event is an opportunity for you to submit **tech-enabled solution** to real-world problems. They require submissions to do one of the following:

* Improve learning opportunities and outcomes for learners across their lifetimes, from early childhood on
* Support financial and economic opportunities for all
* Accelerate healthcare access and health outcomes, reducing and, ultimately, eliminating disparities in health
* Take action to combat climate change and its impacts (Sustainability)
* Address an unmet social, environmental, or economic need not covered in the four dimensions above.

You may submit concepts, prototypes, pilot projects, or fully operational nonprofit or for-profit organizations.

This event is extremely competitive, with even college students being eligible to compete, but high schoolers frequently walk away with prizes from their total pool of $180,000.

You can learn more about the competition [here](https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/solv-ed-youth-innovation-challenge-2).

### Apple Swift Student Challenge

**Typical timeframe**: March-April

**Eligibility**: 13 to 19-year-old individuals

This event organised by Apple every year requires you to submit 'app playgrounds' written in Swift, Apple's own programming language for creating apps for Apple platforms. Winners receive exclusive recognition and perks from Apple, including one year of membership in the Apple Developer Program and a chance to be invited to attend a special event at Apple Park in Cupertino.

Note that you will require a macOS device or an iPad to create Swift playogrounds. Good places to get started with learning Swift and iOS development include [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/), [Kodeco](https://www.kodeco.com/), and Apple's [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/).

You can view examples of winners from the 2022 challenge [here](https://wwdc.github.io/2022/). You can view the official page for the challenge [here](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/swift-student-challenge/).

### Google Summer of Code

**Typical timeframe**: March-July

**Eligibility**: Anyone

Run by Google, this a global, online mentoring program focused on introducing new contributors to open source software development. GSoC contributors work on a 12+ week programming project with the guidance of mentors from their open source organization.

Unlike other entries on this list, this is not as much of a competitive event, however, this means it is a relatively accessible opportunity to learn programming from experts all around the world. We strongly recommend that students from eighth to tenth grade who have existing knowledge of programming with a particular language or framework, and who have significant time available, look into this opportunity.

The application to be a contributor typically opens in March. Coding begins in late May, and ends in late August to early September.

You can learn more about GSoC [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

### Microsoft Imagine Cup Junior

**Typical timeframe**: January-June

**Eligibility**: 13-18-year-old individuals and teams

This competition organised by Microsoft requires teams of 1-6 develop an original concept addressing Microsoftâ€™s AI for Good Initiatives and complete the Imagine Cup Junior PowerPoint submission template. Microsoft encourages that beginners participate, however, the more experience and knowledge you have, the better the chance you have of being one of the top global winners.

Registration typically opens in January, and submissions are normally due in mid-May. You can learn more about the event [here](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/en-us/junior).

### Uber Global Hackathon

**Typical timeframe**: June-October

### Junior Academy of the New York Academy of Sciences

**Typical timeframe**: Year-round

**Eligibility**: 13 to 17-year-olds

Eligible students apply to be a member of the Junior Academy (TJA) of the NYAS, which is a global network connected through the Academy's platform. On a seasonable basis each year, multiple challenges ranging global issues are launched, and members of TJA from all over the world work together in teams to tackle those challenges. Winning solutions frequently involve technology at some level. Since 2021, TJA has typically had a higher acceptance rate than earlier years, however, the application process is still competitive.

You can learn more about and apply to TJA [here](https://www.nyas.org/programs/global-stem-alliance/the-junior-academy/).

## Academic events

These events are the gold standard of achievement in computer science at the national level. However, they are considered to be extremely difficult, and will likely require significant preparation. Success in olympiads is looked upon highly favourably by colleges, both domestic ones (including IITs), as well as the top foreign ones (in the US, UK, Singapore, etc.).

_Note: the olympiads here are unrelated to the ones conducted by SOF_.

### Indian Computing Olympiad

**Typical timeframe**: November-February

**Eligibility**: Any school student

The Indian Computing Olympiad is a nationwide competition organized annually by the Indian Association for Research in Computing Science. It aims to test knowledge of computer science through algorithms and computer programming. It is used to select the team of four students to represent India at the International Olympiad for Informatics (IOI).

At the national level, you may compete in the first round through two events:

1. The Zonal Informatics Olympiad (ZIO), a written exam held across the country. This is typically held in December
2. The Zonal Computing Olympiad (ZCO), a programming exam held across the country. The languages allowed are C, C++, Java and Python. This is typically held in January.

Students can write either ZIO or ZCO or both and qualify through either exam for the second round, the Indian National Olympiad in Informatics (INOI). The only programming language allowed for INOI is C++. It is typically held in February.

Medals are also awarded for performance at each stage of the event.

The event is extremely competitive and requires significant preparation to learn linguistics. You can learn more about the event and access resources for it [here](https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/).

### Panini Linguistics Olympiad

**Typical timeframe**: May

**Eligibility**: Individuals in the Junior (grades 6-8) and Senior (grades 9-12) categories

While not inherently a part of computer science, computational linguistics is a closely related field which students with an aptitude for computer science might have an affinity for. The Panini Linguistics Olympiad is the Indian national program for selection and training of the candidates who represent India at the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL). The competition is coordinated by Microsoft Research Labs India, International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, JNU Delhi and the University of Mumbai.

The event is extremely competitive and requires significant preparation to learn linguistics. You can learn more about the event and access resources for it [here](https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/nlpmt/plo/#/).

### IRIS National Fair

**Typical timeframe**: October-January

**Eligibility**: 13 to 17-year-olds

The IRIS National Fair is a national science fair in India that takes place every year. In the context of technology, eligible projects may include original research papers in areas such as machine learning, original hardware and software creations, and other such scientific projects.

Projects are submitted in September-October. The national fair typically takes place in January. The top students are selected to represent India at the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) in the USA in May, which is considered one of the most prestigious high school science competitions in the world.

You can learn about the event [here](https://www.irisnationalfair.org/).
