At Pathways Noida's inter-school 'Autohacks' event, our three-member team placed second with their project, email.ext, a GPT-poweered Chrome extension that automate replies to emails.

The team consisted of Aarush Aggarwal (grade 9), Shreedhar Raj (grade 9) and Ritwic Verma (grade 11). They built the project with ReactJS and Flask.

You can check out their hack's DevPost page, which details and presents the project, [here](https://devpost.com/software/tsrs-moulsari).
