Our team finished in second place in 'Xquisite' at Xino 2023, DPS Rohini's annual tech symposum.

The team consisted of Harshiet Nanda (grade 11), Aarush Aggarwal (grade 10), Dhruv Kapur (grade 10), and Shreedhar Raj (grade 10).

## What did they make?

The project is a dynamic app that connects sports fans with similar interests through intelligent clustering algorithms. Its main objective is to create a vibrant community by facilitating discussions and interactions among fans who share a passion for the same sports team.

Using state-of-the-art unsupervised machine learning techniques, the app employs scikit-learn's powerful K-means clustering model. This allows the app to analyze user profiles, preferences, and engagement patterns to group fans into clusters based on their shared interests, team affiliations, and other relevant factors. By matching fans with the most compatible groups, the app fosters engaging conversations, enables the exchange of ideas and opinions, and creates a sense of belonging among users.

The app provides a dedicated chat room for each fan cluster, where users can actively participate in discussions, share news, cheer for their team, and express their enthusiasm. By connecting fans who have similar viewpoints, the app enhances the overall user experience and promotes meaningful connections within the sports community.

Additionally, the app offers a range of supplementary features to enhance the user's engagement. It provides comprehensive analytics, data visualizations, and performance graphs that highlight the team's progress and achievements over time. Users can also access targeted advertisements, enabling them to explore and purchase merchandise and tickets associated with their favorite team.

With its focus on intelligent clustering and fostering engaging discussions, this app provides a platform for sports fans to connect, share their passion, and create a vibrant community centered around their beloved sports team.
