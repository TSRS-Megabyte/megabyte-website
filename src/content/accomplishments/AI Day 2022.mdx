Members of the computer society and the ICT department co-organised the school's first-ever AI Day on the 13th of May.

During junior and senior long lunch, multiple installations were set up in cluster A to demonstrate the capabilities of applications of AI. These included:

- An interactive display that prompted students to identify real human faces from AI-generated ones (developed by Rohan Kapur)
- An AI-powered story generator, which generates short stories from a given set of 4 words (developed by Arjun Sharma)
- A piano built of foil and circuits and attached to the foil that plays musical notes when stepped upon (developed by Dhruv Kapur)
- An AI-powered orchestra, in which a laptop webcam would track a user's body movement and automatically change the behaviour of a virtual orchestra connected to a speaker system. (sourced from [experimentswithgoogle](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai))

The organising team consisted of Rohan Kapur (Head of ICT), Advay Gupta (grade 12), Arjun Sharma (grade 11), and Dhruv Kapur (grade 9).
