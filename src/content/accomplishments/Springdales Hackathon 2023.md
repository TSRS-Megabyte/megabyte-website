Our team was victorious at Springdales School's hackathon event. Tasked with building a solution centred around spirituality, the team built an app which allowed spiritual growth and enhancement through meditation, yoga and more. Products such as yoga candles, pills and more could be bought through the app. The app also contained a forum for customers from all over the nation to connect.

The team consisted of:

1. Aaryan Chadha (grade 11)
2. Aviraj Singh (grade 11)
3. Shreedhar Raj (grade 10)
4. Shiv Chandra (grade 10)
