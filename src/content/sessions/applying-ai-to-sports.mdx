Our first AI-focused session will be focused on its applications in sports. We'll build and test basic models for multiple AI-related tasks in sports, and have a discussion on the utility and limitations of using AI in this context.

* Middle school students will use teachable machine to train a sports image classifier  
* High school students will build single and multi-variable linear regression models, using Python, to predict a football player's price based on their stats
