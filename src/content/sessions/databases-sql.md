Moving on from the theme of AI, society members were given exposure to databases and SQL, through an interactive tutorial and challenge exercise.

The session started with a discussion of recent news in the world of technology, from the launch of Threaads to news of a proposed plan for watermarking of AI-generated content.

Then, an interactive tutorial about databases and SQL was given. Members learnt the fundamentals of relational databses, queries for reading and manipulating data, and potential vulnerabilities in database design. The final challenge of the session was attempting to log in to a fake vulnerable site without the password, using knowledge of SQL learnt in the session.

The session ended with a discussion of how SQL and datbases can practically be used in real-world apps and projects.
