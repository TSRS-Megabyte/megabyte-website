In the last session before the summer, we continued our theme of hackathons with a focus on the elements of a strong hackathon pitch. Society members were divided into teams, and brainstormed ideas and products based on the topics of healthcare and fitness. They came up with ideas ranging from AI-powered health monitoring devices to fitness apps that use computer vision to track workouts.
