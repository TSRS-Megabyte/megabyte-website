In the first session of the year, we introduced society members to our goals for the year and started with an introduction to AI, our theme for the month.

The session started with an explanation of the foundational principles of machine learning and broad categories of AI. Then, members got hands-on experience with computer vision and classification with Google Teachable Machine, building a model which classified images of materials as recyclable or non-recyclable.

An interactive discussion of the limitations of artificial intelligence in terms of accuracy and bias was also conducted.
